      <h3>Who maintains this site?</h3>

        <p>This website was created and is maintained by <a href="https://peakd.com/@noisy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krzysztof "noisy" Szumny</a>. In most cases, he is the one, who introduce new features, which are so good-looking only thanks to work of <a href="https://peakd.com/@andrejcibik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrej Cib√≠k</a> - lead designer of this project.
        </p>

      <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
        <p>This website was prepared in a way, that it could be maintained mostly by the community. <a href="https://github.com/wise-team/hiveprojects.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This project is open-source</a>, what means that everyone can contribute, by creating a pull request. Even if you are not a programmer, you can still help by adding information about new projects, which should be listed on {{ SITE_TITLE }} or you can help by creating <a href="{% url 'grids' %}">Comparision Grids</a>.</p>

      <h3>What are grids?</h3>

      <p><a href="/grids/">Grids</a> let you compare {{ FRAMEWORK_NAME }} projects to each other. A grid comes with a number of default items compared, but you can add more features in order to get a more specific comparison.</p>
      <p>For now, we are trying out {{ SITE_TITLE }} without the traditional tagging system, because we think that
          grids give us a lot more specificity.
      </p>

      <h3>What are categories?</h3>

      <p>Categories are broad groups of {{ FRAMEWORK_NAME }} projects into something more granular than Grids. A project can only have one category. Changing then requires backend work, and is not done lightly. This is intentional, done in order to make searching easier.</p>

      <h3>Which source control sites do you support?</h3>

      <p>Github and Bitbucket are supported.</p>

{#      <h3>What about RSS & Atom Syndication?</h3>#}

{#      <p>The <a href="{% url 'syndication' %}">Syndication page</a> has more details.</p>#}
